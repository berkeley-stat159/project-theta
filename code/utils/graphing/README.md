## Graphing functions

These files contain functions used to aid in graphing. 

- `graphoutlier_functions.py` calculates and plots dvars, fd, and mean signal

- `graph_lindiagnostics.py` calculates and plots diagnostic information, namely a
qqplot of the residuals and a plot of the residuals vs. fitted values

- `plot_neural_behavior.py` is a helper graphing function used to plot 
behavorial loss aversion against neural loss aversion used in 
`neural_behavial_plot.py` in `scripts`.
