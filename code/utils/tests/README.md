## Function Tests

This directory contains test files for all user-defined functions located in 
the `project-theta/code/utils/functions`. Specific documentation for the 
functions themselves can also be found there. Each test file name should 
roughly correspond to the function being tested. 

The test text files are the behavorial and model condition files corresponding
to ds005 dataset subject 1 (run 1). These text files are used in regression 
test file `test_regression_functions.py`.
 
## Running the Tests 

To run the tests:
- Navigate to the `project-theta/code` directory
