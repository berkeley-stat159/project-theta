aw bold data and create dictionaries mapping txt or bold files to figures

- `behavtask_tr.py` contains functions to merge behav and task condition files
 and return the predicted neural time course

- `calc_t.py` calculates the t-value of a voxel's beta gain and beta loss

- `lme_functions.py` calculates beta parameters, p-values, convergence info, a
nd ANOVA tests

- `logistic_function.py` has functions to give a confusion matrix on the logis
tic regression and to give the ROC curve and AUC score

- `outlierfunction.py`finds outliers based on DVARS and framewise displacement

- `pearson.py` is the function to find pearson correlation

- `regression_functions.py` contains functions to get regressors, calculate th
e betas and MRSS of a linear regression on BOLD as well as delete outliers 

- `smooth_gaussian.py` functions smooth BOLD data 

- `sig_region.py` is the function to find number and mean of significant p-va
lues for given volume of p-values
